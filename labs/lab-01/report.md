  <li><strong>Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)?<br>List at least two.</strong></li>
  <ul>
     <li>Adding on to courtesy, be sure to be mindful of your words or way of speaking. If you're looking for advice, don't try to be pushy and adopt a "karen" attitude.</li>
     <li>Organize your information. Keep your text organized; the question/error in clear view, and your current process/what you've tried in another. A clutter of jumbled text is hard to decipher, and people may be turned away by it.</li>

  <li><strong>Thoughts on Ch.3 of Free Culture</strong></li>
  I am absolutely astounded by the whole situation of Jesse and the RIAA. As a person of technological interest, experimenting and tinkering is welcome and even encouraged, yet when doing so Jesse instead gets the RIAA demanding to bleed out all the money a university student (possibly with student loans as well) has. A million dollar company, attacking these college students, all for doing what they're meant to be doing using technology that not even they fully created. I do, however, understand the risks that freely available software provides: it gives a grand baseline for projects to fluorish, but can also lead to some problems and clashes in certain situations, just like in Jesse's case.

<strong>Reflection</strong><br>
One open source project that caught my attention is the Thousand Parsec project, found on http://aosabook.org/ within The Architecture of Open Source Applications volume 1. This project holds the premise of a game: users start off on a newly-generated planet, and fortify it with defense and offense mechanisms. The game adopts a turn-based system and players interact with objects using orders. There are more aspects to the game as well, such as resources and designs. Under the Thousand Parsec protocol, the server is responsible for managing the state and dynamics of a game under a ruleset, and the player client receives that information to perform actions based on what is known.
