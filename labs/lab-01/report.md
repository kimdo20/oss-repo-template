  <li><strong>Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)?<br>List at least two.</strong></li>
  <ul>
     <li>Adding on to courtesy, be sure to be mindful of your words or way of speaking. If you're looking for advice, don't try to be pushy and adopt a "karen" attitude.</li>
     <li>Organize your information. Keep your text organized; the question/error in clear view, and your current process/what you've tried in another. A clutter of jumbled text is hard to decipher, and people may be turned away by it.</li>

  <li><strong>Thoughts on Ch.3 of Free Culture</strong></li>
  I am absolutely astounded by the whole situation of Jesse and the RIAA. As a person of technological interest, experimenting and tinkering is welcome and even encouraged, yet when doing so Jesse instead gets the RIAA demanding to bleed out all the money a university student (possibly with student loans as well) has. A million dollar company, attacking these college students, all for doing what they're meant to be doing using technology that not even they fully created. I do, however, understand the risks that freely available software provides: it gives a grand baseline for projects to fluorish, but can also lead to some problems and clashes in certain situations, just like in Jesse's case.
